# microman

**microman** is a powerful CLI tool that scaffolds new microservices using popular backend technologies, and automatically integrates them into your projectâ€™s Docker Compose setup.  
Use it to quickly expand and organize your microservice-based architecture!

---

## Features

- âœ… Scaffold microservices with extensible backends (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, etc.)
- âœ… Automatically updates your `docker-compose.yml`
- âœ… Custom templates via simple extension interface
- âœ… Ready for CI/CD integration

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a new microservice

Run directly via `npx`:

```bash
npx microman new
```

You will be guided through naming your microservice and selecting its technology.  
The tool creates code, Dockerfiles, environment files, and updates `docker-compose.yml` for you.

---

### 2. Install globally (optional)

If you prefer, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g microman
microman new
```

---

## Usage

#### Scaffold a microservice

```bash
npx microman new
```

- You are prompted for a name and the backend technology.
- All boilerplate and Docker integration is handled for you!

---

## Extending

### Add a new technology

Create a new extension in `src/extensions/`, implementing the `MicroserviceExtension` interface.  
Then, register your extension in the main manager (see the existing code for examples).

PRs for new technologies, improvements, and bug-fixes are welcome!
